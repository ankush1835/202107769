        The ingredients for making homemade pasta vary slightly across different recipes, but the basic ingredients typically include flour and eggs. Here are the common ingredients found in various homemade pasta recipes:
        All-Purpose Flour or Tipo 00 Flour: Both types of flour are commonly used for making pasta. Tipo 00 flour is a finely milled, soft wheat Italian flour that creates light and tender pasta with just the right bite.
        Eggs: Large eggs are a key ingredient for adding richness and moisture to the pasta dough. The number of eggs can vary, but most recipes call for large eggs.
        Olive Oil: Some recipes include a small amount of extra-virgin olive oil, which adds richness to the dough.
        Salt: A small amount of salt is often added to enhance the flavor of the pasta dough.
        Semolina Flour (Optional): Semolina flour is sometimes used in combination with all-purpose or Tipo 00 flour to create a heartier texture and help the sauce cling to the pasta better.
        Water (Optional): In some recipes, water is added to adjust the consistency of the dough.</a>
